# Ossum Inc.

Ossum is both a way of being and a new high-technology startup. 
We're just starting, so stay tuned, and we'll eventually document more.

ossum n (genitive ossi); second declension
1. bone (dead)
2. kernel, stone of a nut or fruit

At Ossum Inc., we use the latin word "ossum" via the second definition: kernel. 
We believe we will be at the kernel of software development in due course.
